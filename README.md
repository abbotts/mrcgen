mrcgen
=========
`mrcgen` is a Python based code generation system, originally part 
of the ``MRC-v3`` finite-volume plasma physics code. The original version
was written by Kai Germaschewski at the University of New Hampshire, with
contributions from students and colleagues. This goal with this repository is to
take that ``MRC-v3`` specific framework, generalize it, clean it up, and make it
a more general tool.

Development Plan
------------------
Right now, my goal is to add comments and maybe get some Sphinx documentation
running. Then I need to decide what I actually want this to be, and start
refactoring.
